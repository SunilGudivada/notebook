# Before you start preparing

## Before you start preparing

Effective preparation involves several things. Some of them are pretty obvious and are generally known - first you need to get an idea of what you need to study in general, approximately get an understanding of the front of the work and maybe even write some rough plan preparation that fits into the allotted time.

Here I just want to say that it is necessary - necessary !!!! - set yourself pretty hard deadline. Ideally, apply to a company from your list \(about companies and the list below\), and agree that the interview will not take place immediately, but, say, in a month or two or three. In case of emergency plan hard when you start submitting your resume. Do not under any circumstances prepare for the principle "when I know everything and I am 100% sure, then I will submit" - so you will not send never, and you will hardly prepare thoroughly.

But there is one more important factor that must be mentioned. Namely, the process itself preparation, and how to prepare most effectively. Lucky for us, the topic of effective learning pretty well researched and we don't have to reinvent the wheel. So before you start prepare, be sure to learn how to prepare most effectively. This will save you a lot of time and you can prepare a lot better.

Your task here - to learn and dive into the task entry in a [state of flux](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&prev=_t&sl=ru&tl=en&u=https://lifehacker.ru/2013/02/06/kak-popast-v-sostoyanie-potoka/)... Get ready for something that will be difficult at first, but in about a month of persistent attempts you will master this skill and we are very grateful to ourselves for that.

The second task is to enter the desired emotional state. To be more precise, then you you need to believe in yourself, in your goal and in the fact that everything is achievable. You need to clearly understand why you are are going to spend a lot of time preparing and subject yourself to some stress.

Write these reasons down on paper and read them each time you start preparing. Put yourself a 30 days challenge - for example, every day solve at least 5 problems for algorithms \(or how many in your situation is possible\). Try to measure your progress. Take it as fateful the moment, the turn of your destiny, when everything should change 180 degrees for the better, and now you need to work for this.

Remember that preparing and getting an offer from a dream company is a marathon. It's not about how smart you are, what is your IQ, and how much experience you have in solving Olympiad problems. This is about how much this goal has settled inside you, about intrinsic motivation. And how good you are prepared.

If you have a "low start" - little experience, not very strong knowledge - then this only means that you have to work hard and learn a lot. It won't be easy, you will want it many times  
 quit everything. You will learn not only about sorts, coding, and mutexes, but also to some extent look inside yourself, into your desires, fears, fatigue, irritation. Maybe you even you will cry, considering yourself a hopeless bastard. It will pass, and at the very end it will remain very valuable experience. And, perhaps, a great offer from a dream company.

But that's all - if you can stand it. And in order to withstand, you really need this want, want to change your life and challenge yourself. So take a look inside yourself and see - are you ready?
